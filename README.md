# YTPlayListDownload

app to download the songs from the playlist i listen to, so everytime i add a new song i dont need to go donwlaod it myself

ill use this to write down my ideas dumb or not they will be written

first step PLANNING :
1-ill need to navigate to the playlist i listen to which is ez
2-ill have to figure out how to iterate over each song (i think i will use there xpath like i did in the last project to get thier urls)
3-for every url ill need to figure out a website or app or extension that if i give it the link it will downlaod it or maybe make it downlaod myself
4-also ill save the ones ive downlaoed in my songs file then ill

what we accomplished till now :
1-i got the the number of videos but tunred out the nummber doesnot work because it also calcualtes the hidden videos which links dont technically exist in the page
2-"I" aka preplixty ai found a better way without even askin it, so now we do be using javascript query to get all the links in the page and put them in the links array
3-so now i have the links what is left is to feed them one by one to somthing that will download them
4-also cant forget to make sure if the fiels are downloaded first or not

soooo :
1-its done the app is wokring its litearrly jsut owrks of off yt-dlp like there is not much inevtion in this
2-ill just add a notifcation when the app finsihes
3-also a telgram bot to whcih ill send the downald fiel after i compress it so i can have the song on all my devices

PROGRAM IS FINISHED

idk if i need anything more out of this one if i do ill come back and add to it
